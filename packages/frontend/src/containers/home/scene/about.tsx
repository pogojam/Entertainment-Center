        Big on design and lightning fast code. Found my love for JS developing
        on Node , leveraging the power of Non-Blocking I/O and npmâ€™s rich
        package eco system. Out of necessity I first started learning web
        development in college when I started my first business selling clothing
        online through an e-commerce website. I have since learned more advanced
        techniques building tools for lead generation and business productivity.
